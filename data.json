Interactive toys are known to unleash a kitten’s natural desire to chase, nip, play, chew, swat and even promote harmless biting , scratching and chewing. Kitten toys are the best way to exercise your cat and keep them alert. Fun engaging toys give your cat the sensation of interacting with an actual mouse or a fish ensuring good physical stimulation while the catnips give them a calm and relaxing experience. Ideal for small pet kittens as well as for older cats of Persian and other breeds as well. How to use: We recommend consistent and scheduled playtime. Start with five-minute a day sessions. Just like a dog needs a walk, a cat needs playtime! What is Catnip: Catnip is a plant related to mint and contains an essential oil called nepetalactone that is known to cause euphoric, calming, and relaxing effects on cats. Catnip in small doses is completely safe, non-addictive for your kitten as the effects last about 10 mins for most cats.",

Fun engaging toys give your cat the sensation of interacting with an actual mouse or a fish ensuring good physical stimulation while the catnips give them a calm and relaxing experience. Ideal for small pet kittens as well as for older cats of Persian and other breeds as well. How to use: We recommend consistent and scheduled playtime. Start with five-minute a day sessions.

    "ecom_p_desc": "Why do dogs need to wear shoes? \nDog shoes protect your pet's tender paw pads from hot road surfaces or snow and help keep the house clean even after walking your pet in challenging weather and on muddy grounds. They offer protection from ice, snow, salt, liquid chloride, lawn chemicals, pesticides, fire ants, mud, clay, hot surfaces, and allergens. They help prevent pad rashes, sand irritation, furniture and carpet stains, and swimming pool liner tears. They assist with traction control and post-surgical wound care. \nSo, we introduce you to the BarkButler x TrueLove Dog Shoes, the ultimate footwear solution for your furry friends. Crafted with care and precision, these shoes are unparalleled in their comfort and functionality. Each of these dog rain shoes features an anti-slip grooved sole that provides your pet with superior traction, preventing slips and falls on wet surfaces, making them the perfect choice for dog paw care on both city streets and outdoor adventures.

This catnip toy is shaped like an elephant and helps your cat pursue its true instinctive behaviour and is a great confidence builder especially for cats with anxiety. Kitten teaser toys are the best way to exercise your cat and keep them alert. Fun engaging cat toys give your cat a mouse chase-like feeling ensuring good physical stimulation while the catnips give them a calm and relaxing experience. Ideal for small pet kittens as well as for older cats of Persian and other breeds as well. How to use: We recommend consistent and scheduled playtime. Start with five-minute a day sessions. Just like a dog needs a walk, a cat needs playtime! What is Catnip: Catnip is a plant related to mint and contains an essential oil called nepetalactone that is known to cause euphoric, calming, and relaxing effects on cats. Catnip in small doses is completely safe, non-addictive for your kitten as the effects last about 10 mins for most cats.",

This cat toy is shaped like a crocodile and helps your cat pursue its true instinctive behaviour and is a great confidence builder especially for cats with anxiety. Kitten teaser toys are the best way to exercise your cat and keep them alert. Fun engaging cat toys give your cat a mouse or a ball chase-like feeling ensuring good physical stimulation while the catnips give them a calm and relaxing experience. Ideal for small pet kittens as well as for older cats of Persian and other breeds as well. How to use: We recommend consistent and scheduled playtime. Start with five-minute a day sessions.

What is Catnip: Catnip is a plant related to mint and contains an essential oil called nepetalactone that is known to cause euphoric, calming, and relaxing effects on cats. Catnip in small doses is completely safe, non-addictive for your kitten as the effects last about 10 mins for most cats.",
